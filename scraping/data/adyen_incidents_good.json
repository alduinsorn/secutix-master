Our engineering team has identified that the issue relates to an external technical problem in the settlement of funds for Sofort transactions.  The issue seems to mainly impact three issuing banks within the Sofort network: Sparkassen, AT Raiffeisen and DKB.  As a result, transactions sent for processing between January 8th and January 11th have now been booked to Chargeback as the funds have not yet been received by Adyen.  To mitigate any further impact, Adyen and Sofort have taken the following steps effective as of today, January 22nd at 16:30 CET:  - Sofort has temporarily removed Sparkassen, AT Raiffeisen and DKB from the list of banks available to complete transactions. The banks will be re-enabled in the list once the issue is resolved.- Adyen has temporarily modified its settlement flows so that Sofort transactions are no longer incorrectly booked to Chargeback.

We have noticed acceptance issues for these new cards on some integrations, with instances such as shoppers being unable to enter card details, or being unable to select which card scheme is used.  We have identified a merchant account on this company account that is accepting Bancontact payments. Currently the following integrations are affected:  - Classic Checkout SDKs- Classic Direct API integration - Dependent on merchant implementation- Drop-in / Components below versions: 4.2.0 (Web)- API-only - Dependent on merchant implementation  We have not found any issues for merchants using the following integrations:  - Point of Sale- Classic Hosted Payment Pages (HPP)- Drop-in / Components above the versions previously listed- Pay by Link- Drop-in / Components on iOS and Android  The new Bancontact cards are co-badged with Visa and a key difference is that they have a 16-digit card number (PAN), whereas this used to be 17 with Maestro.  For more information on the issues and ways in which you can fix this please visit the Adyen Docs page linked below. It is always strongly advised to move to the latest version of any integration: https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/bancontact/co-badged-cards)\n"

The identified vulnerabilities could be potentially exploited to allow an attacker perform remote code execution, leak sensitive information or perform a denial of service attack in the affected systems.  The advisories for the affected Log4j versions can be found below:- Version 2.15.0: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046- Version 2.16.0: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105 When the reports for both vulnerabilities were published, Adyen assessed the impact within the next hours and concluded that our platform is not vulnerable due to the very specific conditions that require to be met so that these vulnerabilities can be exploited.  In order to further reduce risks and unknown attack vectors, on December 15th 2021, the Adyen platform was upgraded to Apache Log4j version 2.16.0, and by December 21st 2021, the Adyen platform will be fully upgraded to Apache Log4j version 2.17.0.  We are not at risk of breach nor impacted by these two vulnerabilities.  Please contact Adyen Support (support@adyen.com) in case you have any questions.)\nResolved(On Friday, December 10th 2021, a vulnerability in the Apache Log4j library was detected by the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (NIST), potentially affecting systems running Apache Log4j - allowing an attacker to execute code on a remote server.  You may have seen press reports on this already:- NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228- Apache: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html When we first discovered a report of the vulnerability, prior to the above publication by the NIST, we immediately began testing our platform. We concluded that our core platform was not vulnerable. The platform and supporting systems were upgraded hours later to account for this vulnerability.  We are not currently at risk of breach via the above vulnerability.  Please contact Adyen Support (support@adyen.com) in case you have any questions.)\n"
